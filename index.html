            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>👋 Hi I'm Alexander, I'm a third-year student set to graduate in July this year.
                Through voluntary experience working with a wide range of organisations, I've had the opportunity to develop technical knowledge in a variety of Networking and IT roles.           
                I have experience working in different business environments including a school, charity, and theatre group.
                My passion for sound engineering has helped me develop my problem-solving and lateral thinking skills in a time-sensitive setting. I enjoy working with the community to provide help where I can and interact with a diverse range of people whom I otherwise would not meet.</p>
